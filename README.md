# playing-games-with-neat-algorithm
Location to group my projects using python and the NEAT library

Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies or NEAT is a genetic algorithm that uses generational selection to train an artificial neural network in a process similar to the process of evolution.


Here is the first game I have trained the NEAT algorithm to play.

This repository will grow as I train the algorithm to play more games. Mario, Pong, Galaxian, and Pac man are all games that would be great applications for the NEAT algorithm.
